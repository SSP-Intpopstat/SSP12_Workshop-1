## 📤 Data Submission Instructions
Please upload your dataset to the /submissions/ folder in the Participants-Submission branch.


## 📌 File Requirements:

Accepted formats: .csv, .tsv, .txt, or .xlsx

🔹 We recommend using text-based formats like .csv or .tsv whenever possible. These files are lightweight, can be viewed directly in GitHub, and can be easily imported into R using read_csv() or similar functions.

🔹 Avoid .rds files — they are binary and not Git-friendly.

File size limit: Do not upload files larger than 1MB.

🔹 Please do not submit full microdata or large survey datasets. Instead, share a small subsample for demonstration purposes.

File naming format:
<Country>_<Description>.<file extension>
Example: Bangladesh_CensusSample.csv

## 🔒 Privacy Option:
If you prefer your file to be visible only to instructors:

Email the file directly to the Secretariat team, or

Upload it with a comment in the file (or file name) indicating "Private – For Instructors Only"
